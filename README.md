# MRS-SLAM for long-term place recognition

In this work, we imply an multi-resolution sambling based visual place recognition method.
This work is based on the traditional sequential matching method, our contribution in this paper is to use a coarse-to-fine searching approach to balance matching accuracy and efficiency.
